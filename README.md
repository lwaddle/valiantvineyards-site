# Valiant Vineyards Site

This repository will contain the rebuilt public website for **Valiant Vineyards Winery & Distillery**, including the winery, distillery, bed & breakfast, and event venue.

The project will be built using:

- **Astro** (static-first site framework)
- **Svelte** (interactive components)
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **shadcn-svelte** (UI components)

At this stage, this repository only includes the initial structure and supporting files.  
Implementation will begin after planning the site architecture, URL migration, and content inventory from the current WordPress installation.
